# Conditional

> Make your own conditional expressions more elegant.

_Conditional_ is a super lightweight library that helps you make conditional expressions. You can compose multiple conditional expressions and make them asynchronous easily.

## Why do we need Conditional?

We use conditional branches when writing control flows. For example, using syntactic elements provided by programming languages such as `if`, `switch`, `when`, etc. Let's write a simple control flow.

```javascript
if (A && B) { /**/ }
```

When both `A` and `B` are `true`, the above conditional expression is `true`.
So, how can we implement `A`, `B`, `A && B`?
In a simple way, we can use a function like below:

```javascript
function A() { return true }
function B() { return true }
function X() { return A() && B() } 
```

So what about this one?

```javascript
if (A && B && C) { /**/ }
```

Similarly, let's use a function.
```javascript
function C() { return true }
function Y() { return X() && C() }
```

This is a simple and useful way, but as the conditional expression becomes more complex, the depth of the function call increases, so the code becomes more and more difficult to read. Besides, the test code for it also gets more and more complex.
Not to mention the difficulties of applying the asynchronous paradigm or timeout mechanism to conditional expression.

_Conditional_ provides reusability, testability, and an easy way to apply asynchronous paradigm and timeout mechanism to conditional expression.
Let's take a look!

## Getting started

To add a dependency on _Conditional_ using Gradle, use the following:
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation("com.linecorp.conditional:conditional:0.9.0")
}
```

To add a dependency using Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.linecorp.conditional</groupId>
    <artifactId>conditional</artifactId>
    <version>0.9.0</version>
</dependency>
```

It takes only 3 steps to make and match a conditional expression.
```java
// Step 1: Make a conditional expression.
var a = Condition.of(ctx -> ctx.var("a", Boolean.class));
var b = Condition.of(ctx -> ctx.var("b", Boolean.class));
var condition = a.and(b);

// Step 2: Make a context for matching conditional expression.
var ctx = ConditionContext.of("a", true, "b", true);

// Step 3: Match a conditional expression.
assert condition.matches(ctx) == true;
```

Frequently used conditional expressions such as `true/false/completed/exceptional` can be made as follows.
```java
Condition.trueCondition();
Condition.falseCondition();
Condition.completed(true);
Condition.completed(false);
Condition.exceptional(() -> new RuntimeException());
Condition.exceptional(ctx -> new RuntimeException());
```

If you want to set a timeout in a conditional expression, you can do something like this:
```java
Condition.of(ctx -> true, 3000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
Condition.of(ctx -> true).timeout(3000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
```

If timeout is exceeded, a `TimeoutException` will be raised.
```java
var condition = Condition.of(ctx -> {
    try {
        TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(5000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
    return true;
}).timeout(3000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
var ctx = ConditionContext.of();
condition.matches(ctx); // ðŸ‘ˆ TimeoutException will be raised after 3 seconds.
```

You can also set timeout for more complex conditional expression.
```java
var a = Condition.of(ctx -> {
    try {
        TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(3000);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
    return true;
}).timeout(3500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
var b = Condition.of(ctx -> {
    try {
        TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(4500);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
        throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
    return true;
}).timeout(4000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
var condition = a.and(b).timeout(8000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
var ctx = ConditionContext.of();
condition.matches(ctx); // ðŸ‘ˆ TimeoutException will be raised due to 'b' after 4 seconds.
```

## Asynchronous support

_Conditional_ supports asynchronous for higher performance in I/O intensive operations. First, let's look at the simple synchronous conditional expressions.
```java
var a = Condition.delayed(ctx -> true, 3000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
var b = Condition.delayed(ctx -> true, 4000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
var condition = a.and(b);
var ctx = ConditionContext.of();
condition.matches(ctx); // ðŸ‘ˆ This will probably take about 7 seconds...
```

Below, let's take a look at making conditional expressions asynchronously.
```java
var a = Condition.delayed(ctx -> true, 3000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).async(); // ðŸ‘ˆ
var b = Condition.delayed(ctx -> true, 4000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS).async(); // ðŸ‘ˆ
var condition = a.and(b);
var ctx = ConditionContext.of();
condition.matches(ctx); // ðŸ‘ˆ This will probably take about 4 seconds!
```

Alternatively, you can use `async` method from scratch like this:
```java
Condition.async(ctx -> true);
```

If you want to make all nested conditions asynchronous, you can also do like this:
```java
var a = Condition.delayed(ctx -> true, 3000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
var b = Condition.delayed(ctx -> true, 4000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
var condition = a.and(b).parallel(); // ðŸ‘ˆ
var ctx = ConditionContext.of();
condition.matches(ctx); // ðŸ‘ˆ This will probably take about 4 seconds!
```

Furthermore, even if the colors of conditional expressions are different, they can be composed.
```java
var sync = Condition.of(ctx -> true);
var async = Condition.async(ctx -> true);
sync.and(async); // ðŸ‘ˆ
async.and(sync); // ðŸ‘ˆ
```

_Conditional_ is easy to use even if you are not familiar with asynchronous programming.

## Easy to debug

`ConditionContext` contains information for debugging conditional expressions.
Let's look at the result of executing a simple conditional expression.
```java
var a = Condition.async(ctx -> true).alias("a");
var b = Condition.async(ctx -> false).alias("b");
var condition = a.and(b);
var ctx = ConditionContext.of();
condition.matches(ctx);
```

The execution result of conditional expression can be seen in `ctx.conditionExecutionResults()`. Here, let's look at the execution result for asynchronous conditional expression.

```java
ctx.conditionExecutionResults(); // ðŸ‘ˆ
// ConditionExecutionCompletion{thread=ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-1, condition=a, matches=true, duration=1ms, timeout=INF}
// ConditionExecutionCompletion{thread=ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-2, condition=b, matches=false, duration=0ms, timeout=INF}
// ConditionExecutionCompletion{thread=main, condition=(a && b), matches=false, duration=4ms, timeout=INF}
```

You can see in which thread each conditional expression was executed, how long it took, and what the result was.
Also, it is easy to know whether an exception was raised in the process of executing the conditional expression.

## Easy to integrate with Spring Framework

If you are using [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework), you can also make conditional expressions like this:
```java
@Component
class HelloCondition extends Condition {
    
    @Override
    protected boolean match(ConditionContext ctx) {
        return true;
    }
}

@Component
class WorldCondition extends Condition {

    @Override
    protected boolean match(ConditionContext ctx) {
        return true;
    }
}

@Component
class HelloWorldCondition extends ComposableCondition {

    @Autowired
    HelloCondition helloCondition;

    @Autowired
    WorldCondition worldCondition;

    @Override
    protected Condition compose() {
        return helloCondition.and(worldCondition);
    }
}
```
